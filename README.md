# ParkingGarageMeter

This application will be for a 3-story parking garage to track the cars that are currently parked in the garage with their make, model, color, and license plate number.
It will also track how much time they paid for and will charge them for any extra time. It will also let them know that they have been charged for extra time and how much it is going to be.

To allow for a demonstration of the create portion of CRUD, I will have a database with three empty tables corresponding to each level and when a user parks, it will create
a new entry which will be displayed on the user entry page so the user can see which spots are taken(demonstrating the read).
If a user goes over on time, it will perform an update operation to the price in the database.
When a user has paid, a delete operation will be performed to remove them from the database.

This will use VisualStudio and the C# programming language. I will be using the ASP.Net and the MVC model along with MySQL for the database.
